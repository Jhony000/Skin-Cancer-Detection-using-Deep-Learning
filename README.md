# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
1.skin cancer.txt : Load the data set through kaggle.
2.using the python notebook run it in kaggle notebook because dataset loading process is easy and split the data it into training and test and it also easy to make directory.
3.Preprocessed image data (resizing, normalization, augmentation) to improve model robustness and accuracy.
4.Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify skin lesions and detect skin cancer from dermatoscopic images.
5.Trained and evaluated the model using a labeled dataset (e.g., ISIC) achieving [XX]% accuracy in binary/multiclass classification.
6.Visualized model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess diagnostic capability.
